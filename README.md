# Getting started

To set up the portfolio;

- Create a new repository and open a new branch.
- set up linters to the branch to ensure no syntax or styling errors.
- select a template from figma that you would use to build the portfolio.
- I used one of the templates from figma. its named " figma-template" and it is uploaded to my repository.
- Use HTML for markup and CSS for styling.

I have built two sections

- Nav
- Main
